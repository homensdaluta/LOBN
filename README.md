# LOBN

This project allows the user to ping all devices in the network and detect if the divice is online or not, using the ARP protocol.

At the moment, the Front end part of the program isn't working, only the API.

The reason behind using ARP protocol and not other protocols (UDP) is so that we can detect the MAC Address of the device.
